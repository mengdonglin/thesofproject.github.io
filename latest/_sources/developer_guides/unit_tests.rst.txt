Unit Tests
##########

Prerequisites
*************

You need `cmocka <https://cmocka.org/>`_ to run unit tests.

For building native libraries you can just use package manager to install it,
for example with apt:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install libcmocka-dev

If you want to use `custom version of cmocka <Preparing cmocka package_>`_
(for example for cross-compilation) then you have to provide path to cmocka
built for chosen architecture using **--with-cmocka-prefix** option.

Enabling unit tests
*******************

In order to build and run unit tests you need to provide path to cmocka using
**--with-cmocka-prefix** option of the configure script.

After configuration you can build and run all unit tests by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   make check

There is no need for reconfiguration when cmocka path is set in configuration
script. You can use **make** for building normal APL Binary and
**make check** to build and run unit tests.


Example: Running tests for APL
==============================

In order to build tests for APL platform you have to use `custom version of
cmocka <Preparing cmocka package_>`_.
You can run **./configure** script with almost the same parameters as for
building usual APL binary - just add **--with-cmocka-prefix=<path to cmocka>**,
like:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --with-arch=xtensa --with-platform=apollolake --with-dsp-core=$XTENSA_CORE --with-root-dir=$CONFIG_PATH/xtensa-elf --host=xtensa-bxt-elf --with-meu=$MEU_PATH --with-key=$PRIVATE_KEY_PATH CC=xt-xcc OBJCOPY=xt-objcopy OBJDUMP=xt-objdump --with-cmocka-prefix=/home/admin/cminstall_apl_2017_8/
   make check

Preparing cmocka package
************************

1. Build cmocka with static library on:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cmake <cmocka src dir> -DWITH_STATIC_LIB=ON

   In order to build cmocka with xt-xcc to be linked with a DSP binary code,
   you need two things:

   a. add another option -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=xt-xcc
   #. play with cmocka build scripts to disable building of shared library

#. Mkdir for package to be referenced by main sof build script and copy
   required files there:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir /home/<you>/cminstall
      mkdir /home/<you>/cminstall/include
      mkdir /home/<you>/cminstall/lib

      cp cmocka.h /home/<you>/cminstall/include
      cp libcmocka.a /home/<you>/cminstall/lib

#. Use the target location for cmocka files when invoking *configure* script:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./configure --with-cmocka-prefix=/home/<you>/cminstall ...

Notes
*****

#. It is recommended to use **make check -j** option while running tests that
   use xt-run to speed up tests significantly by running multiple instances
   of xt-run simulator (it also speeds up build if you have many unit tests).

#. When you switch platforms for example from native to APL, please use **make clean**, otherwise make will not build binaries for new platform and your tests will fail.

#. To speed up development of new unit tests you can run specific tests like:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make check check_PROGRAMS="testname1 testname2"
